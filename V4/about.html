        <div id="flex-item1">V4 has been the easiest project thus far. I was able to use the learning objectives that pertained
            to my project. I didn't spend as much time as I have in the past few weeks. When looking over the objectives I knew exactly
            where I wanted to use them in my project. Things came together very nicely. 
        </div>
        <div id="flex-item2">This week I adding the following to my website: text box in a form,radio buttons in a form,selection list in a form,
            text area in a form,submit button in a form, demonstrate how to format a form with CSS,
            demonstrate the use of the video element for embedding video in a Web page (HTML),
            demonstrate how to format media with CSS,demonstrate the use of the iframe element (HTML),demonstrate a CSS animation or transition.
            </div>
        <div id="flex-item3">The only Learning Objective that I didn't use for this project was 
        <strong>M7LO6 Demonstrate the use of check boxes in a form</strong>. Also I was not able to get my iframe to work with 
            the YouTube video I selected so I created my own video to show that I understood the concept.
