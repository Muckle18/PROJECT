        <blockquote><p>For V2 I was able to get a head start on my project. I was much better prepared and ready for 
            the challenge. Although my page is still very basic I was able to add a bunch of code. This week I did 
            a lot of reading and studying. I would spend about 2-3 hrs a day on writing. Some days were better than others.
            Throughout my review I slowly started getting a better understanding of the elements and how they work. </p></blockquote>
