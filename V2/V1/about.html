            This week's Project proved to be much harder than I expected. In my opinion
            I did okay with the html. CSS proved to be an even bigger beast than I realized. 
            I was becoming accustom to html and how to format it but CSS turned my world upside down.
            Although, CSS is referencing from the html it still isn't making sense to me. The use of 
            the {} in itself was challenging for me. With this being said there are a few areas of improvement 
            I plan on addressing this week.
            <ol>
                <li>RE-Read MO2 and the learning objectives</li>
                <li>RE-Do the Mindtap homework and work more on comprehension</li>
                <li>Review the PowerPoint slides for module 2</li>
            </ol>
