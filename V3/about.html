        <div id="flex-item1">V3 went very well for me this week.I was able to finally use all of my learning objectives and actually
        understand what they meant and how they worked within my website. The difference I made this week was I got a head start on my reading
        and I was able to practice the learning objectives.</div><br>
        <div id="flex-item2">This week I adding the following to include: flexboxes,items and containers to demonstrate my customer comments; a calendar to 
            demonstrate the use of tables and span rows;created a table styles css sheet to format a table in html; a media styles sheet
            for mobile devices/pc and a pulldown menu to on the home page. </div><br>
        <div id="flex-item3">Errors: After adding my calendar to my homepage the entire format shifted. I still haven't figured out a solution.
            Also, when I added the pulldown menu hover option a link menu comes up. I still have to workout the kinks for that.</div><br>
